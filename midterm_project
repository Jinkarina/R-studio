## Load and transform data
### Load data
```{r}
# Load data
gmp <- read.csv("mtp_product_data.csv")
gms <- read.csv("mtp_sales_data.csv")
```

### Review data on products

```{r}
head(gmp)
```


```{r}
# Review data
head(gmp)
str(gmp)
summary(gmp)
```

**Observations on the data**

+ There are several cereal brands and some brands have several types of products

+ Most cereal's flavor is regular.

+ The volume seems to be symmetrically distributed. 4 might be the outlier as it is much higher than the 3rd quartile.

+ Most products are packaged in boxes instead of cups.

### Review data on sales
```{r}
# Review data
head(gms)
str(gms)
summary(gms)
```

**Observations on data**

+ It seems that sales are pretty spread out throughout the year.

+ Most products' prices range from $3 to $4.5.

+ Few products were sold with in store promotion.

+ Only around 7 percent of the sales had big advertisements. And around 5 percent of the sales had medium/small advertisements.


### Convert data  

```{r}
# Convert iri_key, promo, and week to factor, integer does not make sense
gms$iri_key <- as.factor(gms$iri_key)
gms$promo <- as.factor(gms$promo)
gms$week <- as.factor(gms$week)

# Convert UPC in the product table to match that in the sales table
# Find and replace dashline with dot
gmp$UPC <- str_replace_all(gmp$UPC, "-", ".") 
# Reduce the strings in the UPC's length to match the UPC's length in the sales table 
gmp$UPC <- str_sub(gmp$UPC, 4, length(gmp$UPC))

# Review data
head(gmp$UPC,5)
```

### Joining data
```{r}
gm <- gms %>%
  full_join(gmp, by = "UPC")

gm$UPC <- as.factor(gm$UPC)

str(gm)
```

### Questions to be followed up 

1. Which brands' sales are most affected by promotions/advertisements?

2. Why only a small portion of sales had promotions/advertisements? 

3. What time of the year did the stores have promotions?  

4. How did the scale of advertisements relate to sales?


# Add code chunks and experiment with ggplot to view the data

## Univariate graphical - categorical 
```{r}
# Code univariate bar graphs using grid.arrange so can see all quant variables together
grid.arrange(
  gm %>% 
    ggplot(aes(week)) + 
      geom_bar(),
  gm %>% 
    ggplot(aes(iri_key)) +
      geom_bar(),
  gm %>% 
    ggplot(aes(brand)) +
      geom_bar(),
  gm %>% 
    ggplot(aes(flavor)) +
      geom_bar(position = "dodge") + coord_flip(),
  ncol = 2
)
```

### Comments and questions on the graphs 

**Comments**

+ Numbers of sales are pretty similar throughout the year. 

+ Some brands have higher sales than the others.

+ It seems that the toasted and regular flavors are the most popular flavors

+ Some stores have much higher sales than the others.


**Questions**

+ Would there be higher sales at the beginning of the months?

+ Do the brands which have higher sales have more advertisements/promotions?

+ Do the sales of flavor relate to promotions/advertisements or time of the year?


## Univariate graphical - quantitative 

```{r}
# Code histograms using grid.arrange so can see all quant variables together
grid.arrange(
  gm %>% 
    ggplot(aes(units)) +
      geom_histogram(),
  gm %>% 
    ggplot(aes(price)) +
      geom_histogram(),
  gm %>% 
    ggplot(aes(volume)) +
      geom_histogram(),
  ncol = 1
)
```

### Comments and questions on the data  

**Comments**

+ Histogram does not seem to be the best graph to present the units data.

+ Most products were sold less than 10 units per week per store.

+ Most products' prices range from $2.5 to $5.

+ Most products' volumes are around 0.5 to 1.5.


**Questions**

+ How do units sold relate to promotions/advertisements?

+ Which cereal package size is the best seller?

+ How does price relate to units sold?


## Boxplots of quantitative data in ggplot2

```{r}
# Set x = 1 to make a boxplot of a single continuous variable 
  ## because the boxplot does not have a width associated with it so gives alignment
grid.arrange (
  ggplot(gm, aes(x = 1, y = units)) +
    geom_boxplot(),
  
  ggplot(gm, aes(x = 1, y = price)) +
    geom_boxplot(),
  
  ggplot(gm, aes(x = 1, y = volume)) +
    geom_boxplot(),
  
    ncol = 2
)
```

**Comments**

+ About 75% of the products are sold less than 12 units per store in a week.

+ Most products have similar prices, while there are some products have very high/low prices.

+ The package sizes of the products are pretty similar.


## Multi-variate graphical - categorical 

```{r}
# tidyverse friendly cross-tab using janitor package 
gm %>% 
  tabyl(brand, promo)
```

**Comments**

+ The fruit flavor seems to have in store promotions more often than other flavors.
+ The regular flavor has the smallest portion of sales with in store promotions.

**Questions**

+ How did promotions help boost the sales of other flavors?


## Multi-variate non-graphical - quantitative

```{r}
gm %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric)%>%
  cor() %>% 
  round(2)

```

**Comments**

+ The correlation between units and price is negative which makes sense since people tend to buy more products when the prices are low.

+ The correlation between volume and price is pretty high, which means that the products' prices are higher when their package sizes are bigger. 

+ The correlation between units and volume is pretty low.


**Questions**

+ What are the factors that affect the correlation between units and price?

 
## Multi-variate graphical - categorical

```{r}
# Note have to calculate and provide a variable for filling the graph
promo_ads<-gm %>%
  group_by(promo, ad) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(promo, ad)) + 
  geom_tile(aes(fill = -count)) + ggtitle("The number of Promotions with or without the advertisements", sub = "Promotions 0 without any advertisements has the highest number of products") + xlab("Promotion") + ylab("Advertisement") + labs(fill = "Counts") + theme_classic() 
            
# Put "-" in front of "count" to reverse color order

# View graph

promo_ads

```

**Comments**

+ The company tends to have in store promotion more than advertisements.

+ The company have big advertisements more often than median/small advertisements.

+ It also tends to combine advertisements with promotions.

**Questions**

+ How do different combinations affect units sold?


## Multi-variate graphical - quantitative

+ Correlation graph    

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Use ggpairs from the GGally package
gm %>%
  select(-week) %>%  # Remove week since correlation is meaningless
  select(-iri_key) %>% # Remove iri_key since it is a categorical data
  select(-brand) %>%  # Remove brand since it is a categorical data
  select(-UPC) %>%  # Remove UPC since it is a categorical data
  select(-package) %>%  # Remove package since it is a categorical data
  select(-promo) %>% # Remove promo since it is a categorical data
  select(-ad) %>% # Remove ad since it is a categorical data
  select(-flavor) %>% # Remove flavor it is a categorical data
  ggpairs()
  
```

**Observations on the graph**

+ Price and volume have the highest correlation
   - Compared to the other two correlations, the correlation between price and volume has much bigger value
   - Price range between 2.5 and 5.0 has the highest volume from the scatter plot graph 
   
+ Units and volume have the lowest correlation
   - From the scatter plot graph of price and units, it is hard to define what is trying to tell because the points are scattered all over the places

## Multi-variate graphical - quantitative

**Scatterplots of interest**

```{r}
# Code scatterplots using grid.arrange so can see all quantity variables of interest together
grid.arrange(
  gm %>% 
    ggplot(aes(price, units)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_jitter() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE),

  gm %>% 
    ggplot(aes(volume, units)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_jitter() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE),

  gm %>% 
    ggplot(aes(price, volume)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_jitter() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE),

  ncol = 2
)
```

** Observations on quantitative graphs**

+ First scatter plots graph shows the relationship between price and units, and it has a negative slope.
  - As the price gets higher, the number of cereal packages sold is decreasing
  - Price range between $2.5 to $6.75 has the highest frequency

+ The second scatter plots graph shows the relationship between volume and units, and the graphs have a slightly positive slope.
 - As the cereal package size increases, the number of cereal packages sold is increasing
 - In the general hypothesis, the biggest volume might be getting the highest selling but the graph shows that the size of 1 to 1.5 is getting the highest number of packages sold.
 - It seems the smaller size of package likely to make more profits.
 
+ The third graph shows the relationship between price and volume, and it has a positive slope
  - As the price is increasing, the volume is also increased
  - A large portion of prices are between $2.5 and $5.0.


## Multi-variate graphical - categorical and quantitative

### Clustered Barplot
```{r}
# Build the clustered bar graph of mean by first create/shaping data, then add graph layers

# First get the data and name the graph so we can build it by layer
d <- gm %>%
# Next de-select Region since can't get mean of factor
  select(-c(iri_key,UPC, week, ad, flavor, package, promo))%>%
  # Remove the factor Region because cannot get a mean
# group_by is by factor level, so group by brand
  group_by(brand) %>% 
# Now we will take the mean of all remaining columns so we can graph them
  summarise_all(funs(mean)) %>% 
# gather is used to reshape the data so can make a bar graph by "Variable"
  gather("Variable", "Mean", -(brand))

```

```{r}
# Now set frame for plot
  # Notice new variables "Variable" and "Mean"
umf_bar <-d %>%  ggplot(aes(x = Variable, y = Mean, fill = brand)) + 
      # Set stat and position to get side-by-side bar
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge")
  # Add labels to each bar
umf_bar <- umf_bar+
      # Add a main title
    ggtitle("The General Mill product has the Highest Profibility") +
    theme_classic()

# Call the graph
umf_bar
```

** Observations on the graph **

+ All the brands have similar means in the volume.

+ All the brands have similar values on the price.

## The number of packages sold by flavor, promo, and ad
```{r}
gr_unit<-gm %>% 
  group_by(promo, flavor, ad) %>% # subsets for each of these variables
  summarize(units = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flavor, y = units, fill = promo, color = ad)) + # Color sets bar border
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    scale_fill_brewer() + # Sets custom color palette for bar
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") # Sets custom color palette for bar border
 # Add labels to each bar
gr_units<-gr_unit+ geom_text(aes(label = round(units, 2)), vjust = -0.5, color = "black",
            position = position_dodge(.9), size = 4) 

# Call the graph
gr_units
```

** Observations on the graph **

+ Compared to the other flavors, regular and toasted are getting extremely higher numbers of packages sold.

+ The pakages without store promotions or advertisements are sold more compared to the ones with advertisements or store promotions.

+ The flavors of Cinnamon toast, Cocoa, and Fruit have similar numbers of units sold.


## New variable Revenue and related graphs

### Looking into the relationship between flavors and revenue
```{r}
# Mutate new variable revenue
gm <- gm %>% 
  mutate(rev = price * units) 
# Looking into the relationship between flavors and total revenue
gm %>% 
  select(rev, flavor, package) %>% 
  group_by(flavor) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = flavor, y = rev, fill = package)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

**Observations on the graph**

+ Even though the regular flavor has much higher units sold than other flavors, the revenue of it and the toasted flavor are very similar.

+ Revenue gained from the cinnamon toast flavor is the third highest even though it has the lowest units sold.

### relationship between flavors and mean revenue
```{r}
# Looking into the relationship between flavors and mean revenue
gm %>% 
  select(rev, flavor) %>% 
  group_by(flavor) %>% 
  summarise(mean_rev = mean(rev)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = flavor, y = mean_rev)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

```

**Observations on the graph**

+ Cinnamon toast flavor has the second highest mean revenue even though it has the lowest units sold.

+ The toasted flavor has the highest mean revenue. 

+ The mean revenue gained from the fruit flavor is the lowest. The probable reason might be that it has the highest portion of promotions.

### relationship between revenue and week

```{r}
# Look at revenue over time
  gm %>% 
  group_by(week, rev, ad) %>% # subsets for each of these variables
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = rev, fill = ad)) + # Color sets bar border
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") 
  
```

**Observations on the graph**

+ Revenue does not seem to have a strong correlation with week and advertisements.

+ There are too many weeks to see the relationships among week, revenue and advertisement.


## Explore the relationships between producers and other variables

```{r}
# Seperating brands by producers
gm$com <- str_sub(gm$brand, 1, 4)
gm$com <- as.factor(gm$com)
summary(gm)
```

There are three producers including General Mills.


### Statistical Validity for producers and flavors

+ Tell if there is a pattern for flavors by each producer    
    - Are the factor levels independent  

+ Null hypothesis: Are all sales the same  

```{r}
# Are flavors and Producers sales similar?
# Not tidyverse so have to use base code
chisq.test(table(gm$flavor, gm$com))

```

+ Reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is much smaller than 0.05

+ The sales of flavors are different for different producers.

### t-test of revenue across producers   

+ Null hypothesis: Revenue is the same across producers  

```{r}
# Not tidyverse so have to use base code
t.test(gm$rev[gm$com == "GENE"], gm$rev[gm$com == "KELL"])
t.test(gm$rev[gm$com == "GENE"], gm$rev[gm$com == "POST"])
t.test(gm$rev[gm$com == "KELL"], gm$rev[gm$com == "POST"])
```

+ Reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is much smaller than 0.05

+ Revenue are different for different producers.


### Significance of correlation for revenue and price

+ Null hypothesis: revenue and price are not correlated

```{r}
# Are the correlations statistically significant?
# Not tidyverse so have to use base code
cor.test(gm$rev, gm$price)

```

+ Reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is much smaller than 0.05.

+ Revenue and price are correlated.


### Revenue by producers
```{r}
# Look at revenue by producers
  ggplot(data = gm, aes(x =com, y = rev)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") 
```

**Observations on the graph**

+ Kelloggs has the highest revenue.

+ Post has the lowest revenue.

+ General Mills has lower revenue than Kelloggs but much higher revenue than Post.


### Units by producers
```{r}
# Look at units sold by producers
  ggplot(data = gm, aes(x =com, y = units)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") 
```

**Observations on the graph**

+ Kelloggs has the highest revenue, while Post has the lowest revenue, which matches what we saw from the graph above.


### Mean revenue by producers

```{r}
# Looking into the relationship between flavors and mean revenue
gm %>% 
  select(rev, com) %>% 
  group_by(com) %>% 
  summarise(mean_rev = mean(rev)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = com, y = mean_rev)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

```

**Observations on the graph**

+ General Mills has the highest mean revenue.

+ The differences among the three producers' mean revenues are not as large as what we saw from the last two graphs.


### Boxplot for revenue and producers
```{r}
# See how revenue is associated with the producers
ggplot(gm, aes(x = com, y = rev)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

**Observations on the graph**

+ This graph explains why General Mills has the highest mean revenue since most of its products have higher revenue than its competitors.

+ Kelloggs has the highest revenue because it has a lot of outliers that have high revenues.


# Detailed EDA

## Questions to be answered

1. How does revenue change over time?

2. What are the factors that affect revenue the most?

3. How do promotions and advertisements affect revenue?

4. How do the promotions and advertisement help General Mills gain revenue compared to its competitors? 


## Finding the answers through tables and graphs

### How does the reveune change over time across producers by promotions, and advertisements? 
```{r}
# Create facet grid to examine how three producer's revenue change over time by promotions and advertisements
gm %>% 
  group_by(com, ad, promo) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = rev, color = promo)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(com ~ ad)

```

**Observations on the graph**

+ It seems that Post is more likely to have advertisement and promotions at the same time.

+ Producers are more likely to combine promotions with median/small advertisements.

### What is the density of revenue, units, and price by producers?
```{r}
# First calculate the means
rev_mean <- gm %>% 
  group_by(com) %>% 
  summarise(rev_mean = mean(rev))

price_mean <- gm %>% 
  group_by(com) %>% 
  summarise(price_mean = mean(price))

units_mean <- gm %>% 
  group_by(com) %>% 
  summarise(units_mean = mean(units))

# Use geom_density
grid.arrange(
  gm %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = rev, fill = com, color = com)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_vline(data = rev_mean, aes(xintercept = rev_mean, color = com)) + # Bring in calculated mean
  xlim(-50, 150), # Had to set bounts to visualize

  gm %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = units, fill = com, color = com)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_vline(data = units_mean, aes(xintercept = units_mean, color = com)) + # Bring in calculated mean
  xlim(-10, 40), # Had to set bounts to visualize
  
  gm %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = price, fill = com, color = com)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_vline(data = price_mean, aes(xintercept = price_mean, color = com)) + # Bring in calculated mean
  xlim(-1, 10) # Had to set bounts to visualize
)
```

**Observations on the graphs**

+ The shape of the distribution for revenue and units are very similar for all the producers, which means that revenue is affected by units sold more than price.

+ General Mills has higher revenue sales than its competitors.

+ General Mills also has higher prices for products and more sales with more units sold. 

### What is the correlations between revenue and units?
```{r}
# First look at the graph of all discounts and profits, by Category and Price
gm %>% 
  filter(ad != "NONE") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = units, y = rev, color = ad, size = price)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 4/5) 

```

**Observations on the graphs**

+ More units and higher prices lead to higher revenue.

+ The relationship between units and prices is not very obvious.

### What is the relationship between flavors and producers?
#### Table
```{r}
# First make a table of counts to calculate the confidence interval
R_C_n <- gm %>% 
  group_by(com, flavor) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

# Calulate confidence intervals using mulitnomialCI           
R_C_n_ci <- multinomialCI(t(R_C_n[, 3]), 0.05) # Have to use t() to transpose the count table  # alpha = 0.05 indicates 95% confidence level

# Next create a table with proportions that is ggplot friendly  
R_C_tab <- gm %>% 
  group_by(com, flavor) %>% 
  summarise(p = n()/sum(nrow(gm)))

# Add the confindence inervals to the table of proportions
R_C_tab$ci_l <- R_C_n_ci[,1]
R_C_tab$ci_u <- R_C_n_ci[,2]

# Show the table
(R_C_tab)

```

#### Visuals of proportions with confidence intervals 

(1) Proportions with confidence intervals
```{r}
# Graph of proportions with confidence intervals
R_C_tab %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flavor, y = p, fill = com)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(p, 2)), vjust=-2.7, color = "black", # vjust moves lables above CI
            position = position_dodge(0.9), size = 4) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_l, ymax = ci_u), 
                width = 0.4, position = position_dodge(0.9))

```

**Observations on the graph**

+ Only General Mills sells the cinnamon flavor. And only Kelloggs sells the fruit flavor.

+ Post only sells the regular flavor.

+ Kelloggs has the biggest numbers of regular and toasted flavor sold. 

(2) Mean with confidence intervals

```{r}
# 90% CI, get z-value for upper tail, use .95 since is one sided
z <- qnorm(.95)

# Incorporate CI into bar graph of means
gm %>%
  group_by(com, ad) %>%
  summarise(m = mean(rev), sd = sd(rev), 
            n = n(), ci = z * sd/sqrt(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = com, y = m, fill = ad)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + geom_text(aes(label = round(m, 2)), vjust=-2.7, color = "black", # vjust moves lables above CI
            position = position_dodge(0.9), size = 4) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = m - ci, ymax = m + ci), 
                width = 0.5, position = position_dodge(0.9)) +
  ggtitle("Mean Revenue is")

```

**Observations on the graph**

+ The means of revenue for no ads are pretty reliable for all producers.

+ The means of revenue for median/small ads are not so reliable for all producers.

+ The means of revenue for big ads are not so reliable for General Mills and Post.

### What are the correlationships between revenue and all other variables? 
#### Multiple regression
```{r}
# Adding an interaction term for Discount and Price because likely related to profit
mod <- lm(rev ~  ad + promo + price + units + volume, data = gm)

# Review output
summary(mod)

```

#### Coefficient table
```{r}
# Pull out the coefficients and confidence interval for table and graph
coe <- summary(mod)$coefficients # get coefficients and related stats
coe_CI <- as.data.frame(cbind(coe[-1, ], confint(mod)[-1, ])) # find and bind CI, remove Intercept 

# Rename results data frame
names(coe_CI) <- c("estimate", "se", "t", "pval","low_CI","high_CI") 

# Print out table
htmlTable(round(coe_CI[order(coe_CI$pval, decreasing = FALSE), ], 3))

```

#### Coefficient graph
```{r}
# Reorder for more clarity
(g1 <- ggplot(coe_CI, aes(x = estimate, y = reorder(row.names(coe_CI),desc(pval)))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  xlim(min(coe_CI$low_CI), max(coe_CI$high_CI)) +
  ylab("Variable") +
  xlab("Coefficient") +
  theme_bw() 
)
 
```


**Observations on the table and graph**

+ We can see from the estimate coefficients that 
  - the promotions and median/small advertisements affect revenue negatively
  - no advertisements, price, and units have positive relationships with revenue.

+ However, since the p-values for the coefficients indicate whether these relationships are statistically significant or not, we can see that
  - the relationship between revenue and median/small advertisements and the relationship between revenue and the volume of the products are not statistically significant
  - the other relationships are statistically significant.
  
  
### What are the percentage of promotions by producers?
```{r}
# percentage table for promotions
d <-   gm %>% 
  tabyl(com, promo) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>%  
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0)

d
```

**Observations on the table**

+ General Mills is less likely to have in store promotions compared to its competitors.

+ Post and Kelloggs have the same percentage of in store promotions.


### How do promotions affect numbers of products sold across producers?
```{r}
# Barplot for revenue by producers and promotions
gm %>%
  count(com, promo) %>%
    ggplot(aes(com, y = n, fill = promo)) + # Color sets bar border
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(n, 2)), vjust = -0.5, color = "black")

```

**Observations on the graph**

+ Kelloggs has the highest numbers of products sold.

+ It seems that the proportion of sales with promotions of Post's is the biggest, while General Mills has the relatively smallest proportion of promotion sales.


### How do promotions affect total revenue across producers?
```{r}
# Look at revenue by producers
tot_promo<-gm %>% 
  group_by(com, promo) %>% 
  summarise(tot = sum(rev)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = com, y = tot, fill = promo)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  ggtitle("Total Revenue across producers", sub= "Kelloggs has the highest total revenue for both with and without promotions")+ xlab("Brand: GENE=General Mills, Kell= Kelloggs, POST= Post Shredded") + ylab("Total Revenue") + labs(fill = "Promotions") + theme_classic()

# View graph
tot_promo
```

**Observations on the graphs**

+ Kelloggs has the highest total revenue for both with and without promotions.

+ All producers have higher total revenues for the sales without promotions.


### How do promotions affect mean revenue across producers?
```{r}
promo_mrev <- gm %>% 
  group_by(com, promo) %>%

promo_mrev
```

**Observations on the graphs**

+ General Mills has the highest mean revenue for both with and without promotions.

+ All producers have higher mean revenue for the sales with promotions.


### What are the percentages of ads by producers?
```{r}
# percentage tables for ads
c <-  gm %>% 
  tabyl(com, ad) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>%  
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0)

c
```

**Observations on the table**

+ General Mills is less likely to have median/small ads compared to its competitors.

+ General Mills and Kelloggs have higher percentages of big ads than median/small ads, while Post has a higher percentage of median/small ads.

### How do advertisements affect total revenue across producers?
```{r}
# Look at revenue by producers
gm %>% 
  group_by(com, ad) %>% 
  summarise(tot = sum(rev)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = com, y = tot, fill = ad)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  ggtitle("Total Revenue") 
```

**Observations on the graphs**

+ Kelloggs has the highest total revenue for across all advertisement categories.

+ General Mills has the second highest total revenue for across all advertisement categories.

+ All producers have the highest total revenue for the sales without advertisements and second highest total revenue for the sales with big advertisements.


### How do advertisements affect mean revenue across producers?
```{r}
ad_mrev <- gm %>% 
  group_by(com, ad) %>% 
  summarise(m = mean(rev)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ad, y = m, fill = reorder(com,-m))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(m, 2)), vjust=-2.7, color = "black", # vjust moves lables above CI
            position = position_dodge(0.9), size = 3) +
  ggtitle("General Mills has the highest mean revenue across  all categories of ads or without ads", sub = "Big advertisements help the producers have higher mean revenue") +
  xlab("Advertisements: A = Big, B = medium/Small, NONE = None") + ylab("Mean Revenue")  +
  labs(fill = "Producers") +
  theme_classic()  +
  scale_fill_brewer() # new color palatte

#view graph
ad_mrev
```

**Observations on the graphs**

+ General Mills has the highest mean revenue for all advertisement types.

+ Big advertisements help General Mills have higher mean revenues, while median/small advertisements do not.

+ For the other two producers, median/small advertisements help them have higher mean revenues.

#### Testing on whether the finding is statistically significant

##### Statistical Validity for producers and mean revenue

+ Null hypothesis: All revenue means are the same for producers

```{r}
# Not tidyverse so have to use base code
chisq.test(table(gm$com, gm$rev))

```

+ Reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is much smaller than 0.05

+ The revenue means are different for different producers.

##### Statistical Validity for promotions and mean revenue

+ Null hypothesis: All revenue means are the same for with/without promotions

```{r}
# Not tidyverse so have to use base code
chisq.test(table(gm$promo, gm$rev))

```

+ Reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is much smaller than 0.05

+ The revenue means are different for with/without promotions.

##### Statistical Validity for advertisements and mean revenue

+ Null hypothesis: All revenue means are the same for big, medium/small, and no advertisements

```{r}
# Not tidyverse so have to use base code
chisq.test(table(gm$ad, gm$rev))

```

+ Reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is much smaller than 0.05

+ The revenue means are different for big, medium/small, and no advertisements.

# Summary

+ Units and prices have positive correlations with revenue.

+ Kelloggs has the highest total sales and revenues, and General Mills has the second highest total sales and revenues.

+ General Mills has the highest mean revenues.

+ Promotions and big advertisements help producers get higher mean revenue.

+ Medium/small advertisements do not help General Mills have higher mean revenues, while they help the other two producers have higher mean revenues.
